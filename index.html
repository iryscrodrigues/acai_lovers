        Açaí, also known as juçara, assai or açaí-do-pará, is a fruit from the
        Amazon region considered a superfood because it is an excellent source
        of calories, rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients,
        because it is rich in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, frequent
        consumption of açaí (Euterpe oleracea), together with a healthy diet,
        can promote various health benefits, such as preventing premature
        ageing, strengthening the immune system and lowering "bad"
        cholesterol.<br /><br />
        Açaí can be bought in fresh form, frozen pulp or nutritional
        supplements, in powder form, eaten fresh, along with manioc flour,
        tapioca, fish or shrimp, or used to make drinks, jellies, sweets and ice
        cream.
